# Ideas

Ideas the team has come up with to play with the jam theme, **Think Inside the Box**.

## Ideation

_Following copied from the Discord chat._

```
- Opposite of "outside the box" -> non-traditional thinking -> opposite would be doing things the "normal" way.
- Could be related to boxes like shipping or freight containers, so something in logistics (I did some management in warehousing, sticks with me)
- Box being a name for a computer, so inside the computer?
- Something about "boxes" like rectangles on the screen? So staying inside the boxes on the screen, or allowing the user cursor to go "outside" those boxes but reacting to it when they do.
Randomly, I like how there's a cloud solution literally called "box.com".
With the Color of Magic concept, I was like "what if every time we make Dockerfiles, it's not a computer making containers, but a really fast sysadmin making a VM?"
```

**lucid_frog**

```
the box:
- something rigid/limited [options]/ finite
- Pandora's box (evil AI, somebody tapping inside your computer, returning unexpected values)

"think inside the box":
- doing a lot from not much
- being creative with limited resources
- showing the unexpected
- "what happens under the cover of.. " / lifting the curtain

with you freight containers analogy, now i kinda want to name it (whatever our project is): Cargo
```

```
-Makes me think of being trapped
-Working within constraints
-For some reason the fact that your inside also really makes me think about wanting to get out
-You have to escape using only whats available to you
-in a computer
Do you know if it is possible to stage a series of terminals or screens. Like create multiple ones independently and have them go from one to another
also idk why but glados and portal stuff really come to mind as well
```

**Xiang**

```
Seeing lucid_frog's idea of Pandora's box, we could maybe make a program that unleashes virus(es) if you open the "box" and you have to do tasks, or you could take this idea in a more prankster sort of manner and just make the consquences of opening the box a series of silly tricks/gags.  
```

- Prompt toolkit can "trap" the user in the screen unless keyboard events are configured. So, it's possible to dictate when a user is able to quit the program (outside crashing their terminal, that is).

## Refinements

**Nomtook**

What if we created some sort of interactive story/game. The user starts out in a situation that doesnt really make sense to them (it's inside a computer), things are backwards, theres 1's and 0's and is introduced to some sort of GlaDOS who in GlaDOS fashion "helps" them out of the box they are in by leading them through a series of full_screen apps/dialog boxes that range from easy to ridiculous and as the user progresses they learn more and more along the way.

one benefit to something like that is it could give us all a chance to implement our own ideas in individual screens/scenarious which would be nice

## Final-ish

*TBD*
