# Pandora

Centering the concept of the app on Pandora and Pandora's box.

[From the myth of Pandora](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pandora):

> In Greek mythology, Pandora (Greek: Πανδώρα, derived from πᾶν, pān, i.e. "all" and δῶρον, dōron, i.e. "gift", thus "the all-endowed", "all-gifted" or "all-giving")[1] was the first human woman created by Hephaestus on the instructions of Zeus.[2][3] As Hesiod related it, each god cooperated by giving her unique gifts. Her other name—inscribed against her figure on a white-ground kylix in the British Museum[4]—is Anesidora (Ancient Greek: Ἀνησιδώρα), "she who sends up gifts"[5] (up implying "from below" within the earth).

[Pandora's box itself](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pandora%27s_box):

> Pandora's box is an artifact in Greek mythology connected with the myth of Pandora in Hesiod's Works and Days.[1] He reported that curiosity led her to open a container left in care of her husband, thus releasing physical and emotional curses upon mankind. Later depictions of the story have been varied, while some literary and artistic treatments have focused more on the contents than on Pandora herself.

## The box is not really a box, btw

From the wiki:

> The word translated as "box" was actually a large jar (πίθος pithos) in Greek. Pithoi were used for storage of wine, oil, grain or other provisions, or, ritually, as a container for a human body for burying, from which it was believed souls escaped and necessarily returned. Many scholars see a close analogy between Pandora herself, who was made from clay, and the clay jar which dispenses evils.

...but we're gonna call it a box, cuz Box things.

Though we can play with the idea that we know of it as a "box" due to a mistranslation (read: encoding problems? eh?) by Erasmus in the 16th century.

## Contents of the box

From the wiki, the account from *The Illiad*:

> On the floor of Jove's palace there stand two urns, the one filled with evil gifts, and the other with good ones. He for whom Jove the lord of thunder mixes the gifts he sends, will meet now with good and now with evil fortune; but he to whom Jove sends none but evil gifts will be pointed at by the finger of scorn, the hand of famine will pursue him to the ends of the world, and he will go up and down the face of the earth, respected neither by gods nor men.

The other poem (the #312 bit) by "6th-century BC Greek elegiac poet Theognis of Megara":

    Hope is the only good god remaining among mankind;
    the others have left and gone to Olympus.
    Trust, a mighty god has gone, Restraint has gone from men,
    and the Graces, my friend, have abandoned the earth.
    Men's judicial oaths are no longer to be trusted, nor does anyone
    revere the immortal gods; the race of pious men has perished and
    men no longer recognize the rules of conduct or acts of piety.

Description in the wiki article for that particular poem states:

> The poem seems to hint at a myth in which the jar contained blessings rather than evils. It is confirmed in the new era by an Aesopic fable recorded by Babrius, in which the gods send the jar containing blessings to humans. Rather than a named female, it was a generic "foolish man" (ἀκρατὴς ἄνθρωπος) who opened the jar out of curiosity and let them escape. Once the lid was replaced, only hope remained, "promising that she will bestow on each of us the good things that have gone away." This aetiological version is numbered 312 in the [Perry Index](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perry_Index).

**Fun number**: leverage the 312 as an answer?

Simplish math problem wrapped in prose to make it slightly interesting, and then throw in the fact of the Perry Index reference (or try not to be so smug and let them figure that out on their own).

    The day of my Genesis marks my prime.
    That day, the hours that passed:
    I am that unlucky product.

- "day of my Genesis", in Genesis, man was born on the 6th day
- "marks my prime", the 6th prime is 13.
- "the day, the hours that passed", 24 hours in a day.
- "I am that unlucky product", 13 being an unlucky number, "product" of 13 * 24 = 312
